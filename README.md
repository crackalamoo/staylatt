# Ortatious Andith ib Staylatt Neller

A set of programs to simulate what English and other languages sound like to people who don't speak them, using both hard-coded phonological rules and neural networks. The neural network (English only) is at `rnn.py`, and the hard-coded phonotactic rule runner is at `rules.py`.
